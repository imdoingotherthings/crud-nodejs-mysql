### CRUD - NODEJS - MySQL - HTML 
Simple CRUD operation using NodeJS MySQL. 

Because we love simplicity, we've decided to use
plain html and grabbing the user input through nodejs using the dependency:
`method-override`.

To use, clone this repo, enter your database and password, then run these commands 
in your terminal: 
> First Terminal Tab: nodemon
> Second Terminal Tab: mysql -u root -p 

You're good to go! Enjoy the demo! 

This project will conitue to be updated until further notice.
